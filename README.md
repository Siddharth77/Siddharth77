👋 Hello, I'm Siddharth Jain, and my GitHub ID is @Siddharth77. I have a keen interest in JavaScript, drawing inspiration from experts like Kyle Simpson and Douglas Crockford (whose work on JavaScript is truly enlightening!). I actively work with JavaScript frameworks and libraries, particularly Angular and React.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge in React, ES6, and Redux. My goal is to transition from Angular to React, as I believe it offers exciting opportunities for UI development.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that aim to revolutionize the way we approach UI development. If you have any ongoing projects that can bring about a positive transformation in this area, I'd be thrilled to contribute and work together.
